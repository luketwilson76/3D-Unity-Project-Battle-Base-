Battle Base is a FPS strategy game that combines the movement shooting of DOOM and the building aspect of Minecraft. In Battle Base, you're humanity's last hope and must fight the evil robot AI. To do this you must establish bases and protect them against the enemy AI hordes. This game will feature a variety of weapons and abilities to fight the robots.  
This game is in it's genesis stage and many gameplay elements will drastically change in the final product. Right now I am just experimenting with game mechanics, models, and animations.
